# Maple Eagle Trade Tracker

Welcome to the **Maple Eagle Trade Tracker**! 

In light of the tariffs imposed on Canadian goods by the government of the United States, the Canadian government faces the challenge of understanding how the US tariffs will impact different Canadian businesses and how Canada can best formulate retaliatory tariffs in response.  

The **Maple Eagle Trade Tracker** is an interactive dashboard that visualizes trade data between Canada and the United States. It allows users to explore key insights, including which Canadian sectors export the most to the U.S. and which U.S. sectors export the most to Canada. The dashboard also tracks trade trends over time and provides detailed breakdowns by province and sector. By offering real-time analytics, the dashboard can aid Canadian policymakers assess the impact of the tariffs and make informed policy decisions.
