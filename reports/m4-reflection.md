## Reflection:

Regarding the development of our dashboard, the feedback we received during our time in the lab was incredibly helpful. During these discussions, we explored potential upgrades, including new implementations that could enhance overall performance. These include instructions for caching data with flask, improvements to the map functionality (such as updating callbacks to allow selecting all countries when no options are chosen in the dropdown), the optimization of the layout, and visual updates to the import/export value cards to adjust the number formatting allowed us to see potential improvements in places which we may not have noticed ourselves as a group internally. 

Reflecting on our original app sketch, I believe we successfully incorporated most of the key functionalities we initially envisioned. All plotting segments, including the sector/industry and provincial callbacks, were implemented, as well as the charts from the original sketch. The biggest deviation from our initial design is the final layout of the dashboard. While all components were included, we made several adjustments to the layout before settling on the current design. One major change was the placement of the filtering menus, which were moved from the top to the left side of the dashboard. Additionally, we added a logo to the app, which wasn't part of the original sketch. Another significant update this week was the color scheme and formatting for the charts and metrics. The line plot dots now have colors based on their values, and the card values for total imports/exports have been adjusted for better readability. Overall, we made several aesthetic decisions this week, some of which differ slightly from our original sketch. The reason why we made these choices were simply due to design optimization as new changes we implemented look better than the layout originally in our sketch. 

Regarding key practices which we learnt from 531 regarding effective visualizations, our plot selection was completed with many of the principles from this course considered. Color schemes were selected that allowed a clear view of positive and negative impacts in our plots. The correct plots were also selected to ensure that the data is reflecting correctly, such as using line plots to plot net sales over time. Proper labels and titles were also added to ensure that our plots all have the correct human readable labels which describe each plot. 

Regarding limitations of this dashboard. I think one dashboard limitation we have is that on the Statistics Canada portal there are more datasets available that allow us to go into more granular trade sectors. If we had time we would have considered adding in another dataset and joining with our existing database.I think however what our dashboard excels at is the ability to show high level trade details on our country's trade deficit and surplus on a provincial level.

Finally, we collected the major modifications based on the feedback form instructor/TAs/peers in [changelog](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/blob/main/reports/changelog.md).
