## Reflection

For this week’s milestone, our team’s primary focus was on ensuring the functionality of the dashboard and verifying that the key principles from every chart were displayed correctly. We also aimed to get an initial look at some of the projected numbers. For each of the 10 components outlined in the sketch, we focused on making sure that the charts render properly, though we placed less emphasis on formatting and the layout and other aesthetic features.

With the 10 functioning components from the sketch, our original draft has slightly deviated regarding the layout from the original. We might choose to relocate the callback dropdown to the left side of the page instead of the right or top to align with more conventional dashboard configurations. The color theme for the map and other figures have you to be finalized as well and there may be some additional design related decisions which will impact the overall feel of the dashboard. We have also decided to limit the functionality of our sector bar plot as data limitations from a separate file where the sub-sectors did not have a provincial level breakdown. 

There has been no deviation from the original best practices from 531 regarding effective visualizations. These principles form the foundation for our decisions, such as choosing the appropriate plot types, ensuring all plots are properly labeled, and applying appropriate color schemes. Concepts revolving around ensuring our dashboard is reproducible has been taken into account as well to ensure the dashboard serves a continued functionality. 

Our dashboard currently excels at displaying the key metrics and providing a sense of how the interaction works with the callbacks. However, the layout of the plots and other design aspects are still a work in progress. The improvements we’re focusing on include enhancing aesthetics, refining the design, and testing the callback interactions. Additionally, we’ll evaluate whether any adjustments are needed for the map and sector plots as they share the same features as the callback menus. One other limitation to mention is that the margins of our dashboard will need to be adjusted, currently we would be required to scroll lot to view the dashboard.
