## Reflection

For milestone 3 the team's primary focus was on refining the dashboard based on feedback received from the instructor and peer review. Some key refinements implemented include enlarging the map, re-arranged dashboard components per our new-sketch, addressed selection ambiguity around the "All" option by using a checklist instead, implemented adjustable "Total Import Value" and "Total Export Value" cards and improved dashboard aesthetics by displaying graphs in cards for clearer boundaries. In addition, we have modularized our code in the src folder for improved readability and maintainability.

We had originally planned on implementing a feature that allows users to select provinces directly through the map, instead of using a checklist/dropdown. However, this feature proved to be too technically challenging for this milestone due to the complexity of implementing interactive map-based selections using Dash and Altair. We spent a significant amount of time trying different approaches, but we encountered persistent challenges in enabling multi-selection through map clicks. Despite our efforts, we were unable to achieve the desired functionality within the given timeframe, so we decided to rely on checklist selection for now. Another challenge faced was optimizing chart sizes such that it renders properly on browser windows of different sizes, as the team realized certain charts may collapse/overlap when opened on a smaller browser window.

Daniel suggested adding break lines to plot with labels that are too long. In the end we opted to  keep the original sector titles on the y-axis as adding break lines would make the axis uneven. To address the space constraint, we repositioned the sector plot at the bottom through re-layout. Although break lines were suggested for better readability, we found that preserving the original titles maintained a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing design. In our opinion, the current plots with the original sector titles look more visually appealing compared to those with break lines.

There has been no deviation from the original best practices from 531 regarding effective visualizations. These principles form the foundation for our decisions, such as choosing the appropriate plot types, ensuring all plots are properly labeled, and applying appropriate color schemes. Concepts revolving around ensuring our dashboard is reproducible has been taken into account as well to ensure the dashboard serves a continued functionality.

Due to the technical challenges mentioned above, province selection via the map was not implemented and our dashboard continues to rely on two checklists for selection. However, it is still our view that selecting provinces via the map is more intuitive and will enhance user experience. Our team will perform further attempts in resolving the technical challenges faced in the upcoming week.
