## Change log for Milestone 4  

### Part 1: Feedback from Instructor & TA:  
1. Fix the issue with Quebec so it displays correctly on the map. [d52dcb8](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/commit/d52dcb8877e5fce4b7da461fdc54a24cea9a0728)  
2. Ensure plots show all provinces by default when no specific selection is made, preventing empty charts. [05ee8d9](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/91/commits/05ee8d91615525180fd88ec21094901336f12a4b)  
3. Colorize points in the net trade chart: use green and red enhance clarity. [1ac4eee](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/94/commits/1ac4eee9a697ccd18d5f18fe25a67d7c9854d4dc)  
4. Save the geographic map data to load it efficiently instead of redownloading each time. [7c416f4](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/91/commits/7c416f429da745393f0b8cfa7ec5469877445afa)  
5. Add a log scaling option for the two bottom plots and cache them for better performance. [2627e0c](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/94/commits/2627e0c932f47f0b363d54e9cc0d0b275d0240e9), [6c353b2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/commit/6c353b2d00e4e525af0a097b126c6ce14f119702)  
6. Use shorter labels instead of line breaks to improve readability for the two bottom plots. [fc48d6f](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/94/commits/fc48d6f65f5d63135b7a0be8357df38d158d88b4)  

### Part 2: Feedback from Peers:  
1. For the bar charts of annual import and export, maybe tilting the x axis tick labels at an angle would make it easier to read. [f21a197](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/94/commits/f21a197b8bca8198b2c4a7c50c5828f3fa62f4ec)  
2. For both the chart axis and the card component, it would be better to scale the values accordingly, e.g. 1 million instead of 1,000,000. This makes reading the number and comparing numbers easier. [814b49d](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/pull/89/commits/814b49de3b4fa01c5315f47db6ada06861d84a8b), [7b6adcf](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/commit/7b6adcf007732c598baaa245d35269111e896e94)  
3. The dashboard layout was not very organised, I would prefer to have the filters stay on one side of the dashboard, also putting a border outside of the map would make it more visually appealing. [e8ce5fa](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/commit/e8ce5fafdcc1f303aee98d4c36d59dda86b06a32)  
4. Maybe it would be better to use checkboxes instead of drop-down since you have so many provinces and sectors. This way, users can select multiple filters at once, instead of choosing it one at a time in the drop-down filter. [b63d9cd](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2025_13_Maple-Eagle-Trade-Tracker/commit/b63d9cdff8cdf7034e0e441acea845acadd43372)  
5. I suggest updating the color scale on the map so that values below zero become progressively redder, values above zero progressively greener, and zero is represented as white. This adjustment would make it easier for users to quickly determine whether a province has a trade surplus (light green) or deficit (light red), compared to the current scheme where zero is represented by orange.
